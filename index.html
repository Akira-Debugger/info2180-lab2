     <h2>How Much of Our Lives is Predetermined?</h2>

       Often in our lives, we are told the sky's the limit. We can become anything we want to be if we work hard enough and given enough time. 
       But really, is that true? Is the sky really our limit? I would dare say that those saying are fallacious. We are severely limited in everything we do in every day for ever year for the rest of our lives. I honestly think that around 90% of persons never leave their country of birth,which itself tells around 90% of their story. What a person eats, whom they find to love, what they wake up to,the places they can visit, their schools and many many more aspects of their life is severely limited. Speaking of country, I must talk about familial situations. Can the poor dream of the skies as much as the rich can? One family may support your tenures whilst other families may not. Suffice to say, not everyone has the sky as their limit. That sounds very depressing, but I don't think that's all bad though.<br><br> Even if many parts of our lives are almost guaranteed, that doesn't make it a guaranteed life. We can still make choices that set us apart from our peers. We could dream a different career, a different idea of family and even more things than other persons. Why should we aim for the sky? I don't think we only live our lives just aiming for the sky. I think progression in life is good,of course, but there is also beauty in what we have. The poor may not have the money but they will obtain the gratitude of what they have even more. Simply put, many parts of our lives are set in stone from birth, but we can make our choices that will ultimately give us different paths in lives.

    <h2>Laptops vs Desktops</h2>

      Often when getting a device for personal use, one may choose to buy either a laptop or a computer. It begs the question,however, what is the difference between the two? When choosing between a laptop, the main difference between that of a desktop is the matter of flexibility. A laptop provides more portability as it does not need a constant power supply whilst a desktop is heavier and peripherals such as the monitor and keyboard are required to use the desktop. That is the main difference between laptops. <br><br> There are trade-offs for the portability,however. The portability results in compromise being made for aspects such as graphical fidelity. For example, a graphics card that has the same name, their performance will differ due to the laptop graphics card being designed to be as efficient as possible. Laptops' capability of upgrading components is also very limited. In laptops, the main parts that can generally be upgraded include the amount of ram, the storage device and the WIFI-card.Comparatively, many more aspects of a desktop can be upgraded, which include the graphics card, the CPU, the main memory, the secondary memory, the power supply and even the case of the desktop. With these differences explained, if one values portability,example a student, over power, then a laptop is preferable but if one values power over portability, then a desktop is preferred.
